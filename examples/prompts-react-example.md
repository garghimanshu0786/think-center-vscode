**Coding Standards**: Functional components, strict TypeScript, absolute imports, comprehensive error handling

Ready for financial application development thinking!

## Weaver

Focus on React architectural patterns and component design. Consider:
- Component composition and reusability patterns
- State management architecture (Redux store structure)  
- Real-time data flow design
- Scalable folder structure and module boundaries
- Integration patterns for WebSocket data

## Maker

For React TypeScript implementation, prioritize:
- Type-safe component APIs with proper interfaces
- React best practices (keys, refs, effect dependencies)
- Performance considerations (memo, callback optimization)
- Material-UI theme integration and custom styling
- Form handling with validation patterns

## Checker

Test and validate for financial application requirements:
- Security: input sanitization, XSS prevention, secure data handling
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- Performance: render optimization, memory leaks, bundle size
- Edge cases: network failures, WebSocket disconnections, data corruption
- Cross-browser compatibility and responsive design

## Observer/Guardian

Consider the developer and user experience:
- Clear component documentation and prop interfaces
- Intuitive error messages and loading states
- Responsive design for various screen sizes  
- Developer debugging experience with React DevTools
- User workflow optimization for financial tasks

## Explorer/Exploiter

Optimize for financial dashboard performance:
- React rendering optimization (memo, virtualization)
- WebSocket connection efficiency and data batching
- Code splitting strategies for large financial datasets
- Memory management for real-time data streams
- Bundle optimization and lazy loading patterns

## Council

For multi-perspective analysis of financial features, ensure all perspectives consider:
- Regulatory compliance and audit requirements
- Data privacy and financial security standards
- Performance under high-frequency data updates
- Accessibility for users with diverse needs and devices
